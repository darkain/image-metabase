<h1>Searching for partnerships</h1><div>
<p>In the search for web site partnerships, there seems to be common misunderstandings about what
<a href="http://metabase.darkain.com/">The Image Metabase&trade;</a> and more specifically The
Cosplay Metabase really are.  <a href="http://metabase.darkain.com/">The Image Metabase&trade; Homepage</a>
now contains a basic FAQ for those of you confused about this service.  The FAQ will be updated over time
as more concerns arise.</p>
<p>And now, to the topic at hand: The Cosplay Metabase team is currently searching for partners.
We are searching for web sites and individuals with cosplay photo galleries that wish to participate
in our indexing system.  Our team is dedicated to providing a fast and user-friendly way for people
to search through photographs, but this system will not be useful without any content to search!
If you wish to become a partner, please contact me at
<a href="mailto:darkain@darkain.com?subject=The Cosplay Metabase">darkain@darkain.com</a></p>

<h1>Open for Beta Testing</h1><div>
<p>The Cosplay Metabase is now open for public beta testing.  This is the first public test of the
<a href="http://metabase.darkain.com/">Image Metabase&trade;</a> software.  This web site is
designed to help organize, search and locate across multiple online web sites.  This site is like
a search engine.  This site is NOT an image hosting service.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="http://www.cosplay.com/">Cosplay.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a> are supported.  To add images to become searchable,
<a href="login.php">Login/Register</a>, and use the profile page to add URLs to images.</p>
